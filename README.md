# üéì EduView AR ‚Äì Augmented Reality Visualizer for Mathematical Equations

## üìå Overview
**EduView AR** is an innovative augmented reality application that visualizes complex mathematical equations in real-time using immersive 3D models. By scanning math expressions from images or PDFs, users can interact with corresponding 3D shapes within their physical environment, making abstract concepts more tangible and intuitive.

Built using **Sceneform** and **ARCore**, EduView AR brings modern AR experiences into education, allowing users to explore geometry and calculus in a whole new dimension.

## üöÄ Key Features

- üì∑ **OCR-Based Equation Detection**  
  Extracts mathematical equations from images and PDFs using Optical Character Recognition.

- üìê **3D Equation Rendering**  
  Displays 3D models such as spheres, paraboloids, and other geometric forms based on the detected equation.

- ‚úã **Interactive Controls**  
  Scale, rotate, and position the 3D model directly in the AR space.

- üì± **Sceneform + ARCore Integration**  
  Delivers stable, markerless AR experiences with real-world environmental tracking.

- üß† **Educational Focus**  
  Aims to assist students in visualizing mathematical concepts more effectively.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Main Note

> ‚ùó **Important Notice:**  
This project encountered compatibility issues due to changes and deprecation in the official **Sceneform** and **ARCore** support. As a result, the project may not function as expected with the latest versions of Android Studio or AR libraries.

Anyone intending to use or contribute to this project should ensure:
- Proper versions of **Sceneform SDK** and **ARCore** are used (preferably legacy or compatible forks).
- Dependencies and Gradle configurations are correctly aligned with the working setup.
- Testing is done on supported Android devices with ARCore capabilities.

We recommend checking for updated forks or open-source alternatives to maintain stability in newer environments.
